            <h2> Hi! Nice seeing you around here.</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the maze of REALITY. Where you can explore, have adventures (sort of), <br>
                and most importantly you can take a break from daily life and hangout a bit with me, The Narrator!
            </p>
            <p>
                ... <br>
                Well you dont seem excited. <br>
                <br>
                I guess all you want to do is get out of here ASAP. Well to do that you'll have to travel through the maze and find the exit. 
                <br>
                Hm.. You are wondering if i know the exit. Well of course i do! But if i tell you that would ruin the FUN. Also I cant get out myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                You will be traveling by clicking urls and eventually find clues that you may open on a new tab. (Yes im aware that we are on a computer and a browser so try not to cheat)
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                So what do you say? Let's see if you can get out, I'll narrate your adventure. Nice meeting you, call me N. Click continue to start your journey.
