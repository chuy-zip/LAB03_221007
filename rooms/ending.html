                So this is how things end. You get to go out on the world while I get stuck here for who knows how much time.<br>
                But don't worry about me, probably every now and then I'll have some visitors willing to spend some time with me and have fun.<br>
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                Or at least I hope so. Sorry for everything, its just It sometimes gets realy lonely here.
                <br>
                I hope you at least had a bit of fun :]. There is just one last thing...

            <p> Just ask yourself, was it actually worth to scape this REALITY just to return into one where you actually can't scape?<br>
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                I can't get out of here so i don't know how the world really is. It must be scary. So please take care.
