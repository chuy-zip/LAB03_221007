        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ricardo Chuy. I am a student at "Universidad del Valle de Guatemala", and this 
        <p>
            project is part of an assignment from the course Web Systems and technology. The idea is to make
        <p>
            an interesting and immersive story using only HTML. I made my story inspired in suspense and fiction.
        <p>
            Hope you enjoy it! To win you will have the maze of "The Narrator" AKA N. He does not want you to leave.
        <p>
            So don't trust everythin he says. Explore and find 2 sticky notes with clues to find the exit.
